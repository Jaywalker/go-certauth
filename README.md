certauth
========
This package provides TLS certificate based authentication middleware.
Only  compatibile with `httprouter`.

Usage
-----

Examples of usage with various http router libs in the `./examples` directory. But they're broken right now.

Contributing
------------

You can try, but probably better to just fork me like I did with this to start with. Unless you're very lucky,
I'll probably ignore any pull requests or tickets.

Acknowledgments

A big thanks to the https://github.com/unrolled/secure project whose approach to
writing middleware helped us figure out our approach to creating this project.
